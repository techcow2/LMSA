Last Updated: May 27, 2025

At TechRay Apps LLC ("we," "us," or "our"), your privacy is of utmost importance. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and share your personal information when you use LMSA (LM Studio Assistant), including both our Android app and the LMSA website (lmsa.app). It also outlines your rights and the measures we take to protect your data. We are committed to complying with all applicable privacy laws and regulations, including but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), and other relevant frameworks.

By accessing or using LMSA or our website, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with any part of this policy, please discontinue use of our services immediately.

LMSA Privacy Overview
LMSA Android App: The LMSA Android app is designed to minimize data collection while providing essential functionality and monetization through advertising.

The LMSA Android app collects limited data for the following purposes:

Advertising: We use Google AdMob to display advertisements, which may collect device information, advertising identifiers, and usage data for ad personalization and measurement
App Functionality: Basic app usage data may be collected to ensure proper functionality and performance
Conversations: Your conversations with AI models remain on your devices and are not transmitted to or stored on our servers
Local Data: Character data, chat history, and settings are stored locally on your device
LMSA is designed to connect directly to your local LM Studio server, keeping your AI conversations on your own devices. The app functions as a client interface and does not route your conversation data through our servers.

LMSA Website: Our website (lmsa.app) uses analytics and customer support tools:

Umami Analytics: We use Umami, a privacy-focused analytics platform, to collect anonymous usage data about how visitors interact with our website. Umami does not use cookies and does not track users across websites.
Crisp Chat: We use Crisp for our customer support chat functionality. If you choose to use the chat feature, Crisp may collect information you provide during the conversation.
Important Security Information: LMSA does not currently encrypt communications between your Android device and the LM Studio server on your local network. This means that if someone is monitoring your network (through packet sniffing or other network surveillance techniques), they could potentially intercept and view your conversations with AI models. Please be aware of this limitation when using LMSA on public, shared, or potentially compromised networks.

Additional data collection may occur through the Google Play Store for basic app functionality (such as app downloads, updates, and crash reports), which is standard for all Android applications.

6. Data Security
We take appropriate measures to protect the limited data we collect:

6.1 Website Security
Our website uses HTTPS encryption for secure data transmission
We regularly update our website software to address security vulnerabilities
Access to analytics data is restricted to authorized personnel only
6.2 App Security
LMSA Network Security Disclosure
Please note that LMSA (LM Studio Assistant) currently does not implement encryption for communications between your Android device and the LM Studio server running on your computer.

This means:

Data transmitted over your local network is not encrypted
If someone has access to your network and is using network monitoring tools, they could potentially intercept and view your conversations with AI models
This vulnerability primarily exists on shared, public, or compromised networks
For maximum security, we recommend using LMSA only on private, secure networks that you trust, and avoiding use on public Wi-Fi networks or networks you don't control.

7. User Rights
Even though we collect minimal data, you still have important rights regarding your personal information:

Right to Access: You can request information about what data we have about you
Right to Correction: You can request that we correct any inaccurate information
Right to Deletion: You can request that we delete your personal information
Right to Object: You can object to our processing of your data
Right to Restrict Processing: You can request that we limit how we use your data
To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at privacy@techray.dev.

8. International Data Transfers
The limited data we collect may be processed in countries outside your country of residence:

Our website analytics and chat services may process data in the United States or European Union
We ensure that any international transfers comply with applicable data protection laws
For transfers to countries without adequate data protection laws, we implement appropriate safeguards
9. Children's Privacy
LMSA and our website are not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately.

LMSA Website: Uses minimal analytics (Umami) and customer support tools (Crisp) that respect user privacy.
